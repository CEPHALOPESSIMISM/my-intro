<p align="center"> Yo! I'm <b>Zeke</b> (<i>u may also know me as Fritz</i>)! I'm 19 (<i>birthday is May 3</i>) and use he/it pronouns as well as pup/pups, claw/claws, and were/weres neopronouns. I identify as agender and bisexual, and I'm also open to polyamory. I taught myself how to draw and focus mostly on digital works. I'm also a total NERD when it comes to insects (<i>my dream career is orthopterology</i>).

<p align="center"> I'm a disgustingly anxious individual (<i> I've been struggling with anxiety since I was a kid...</i>) and thank god I'm medicated. I can also be insanely awkward. I tend to yap about topics I'm passionate about and can do so for hours. Especially insects!

<p align="center"> I'm really into Total Drama, FNaF, Pokémon, Loomian Legacy, and Deddy Bears. I just recently got into Block Tales on my own accord. I'm begging other Total Drama fans to interact!!! Especially if you love World Tour, that's my absolute FAVORITE season.

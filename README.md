<p> Hey! I'm Zeke/Fritz!!! If you're reading this, chances are you saw me on ponytown or you seen me in someone's follow list. I'm typically sitting on my friend, don't be afraid to whisper me ir say hi ^_^ </p>

You guys are gonna hate this... I'm a fictionkin (WOW LAAAAAME) of multiple characters but my highest kin is Ezekiel from *Total Drama* if it weren't so disgustingly obvious...

**I'm medicated for anxiety** but that doesn't mean I can recover quick or that I'm immune to the affects of it. Typically I can still communicate, however, there are some times I go nonverbal (*will be in the name of my skin on ponytown*) because of it.

I'm a yumeshipper!!!! If you don't like that block me or something idk. SOME of my f/o's are on my pronouns.cc, but not all. Some I'm too scared to add.
